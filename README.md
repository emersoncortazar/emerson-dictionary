Emerson’s Dictionary is a browser-based text analysis tool that helps users identify and study uncommon vocabulary in their reading. Users can upload .txt files, automatically extract rare or sophisticated words, view contextual examples, and build a personal dictionary with custom definitions — all running entirely client-side.
